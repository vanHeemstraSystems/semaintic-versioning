## 100 - Create project using tsdx and git push to GitHub

In a terminal create a new npm project as follows:

```
$ npx tsdx create your-package-name-you-want-to-see-on-npm-lol
```

When asked for a template:

```
? Choose a template ...
> basic
  react
  react-with-storybook
```

Choose **basic**.

After npx has created the directory and some files, move inside the newly created directory:

```
$ cd your-package-name-you-want-to-see-on-npm-lol
